# Rowing Vikings

Rowing vikings mod makes your cotravelers a bit less useless on long ship cruises.

Every *sitting* person on your ship (excluding the captain) increases rowing speed by 25% - it's not much but it certainly helps if wind isn't in your favour.

Please note that it only sitting viking will contribute - ones that hold the mast or the figurehead can't row anyway.

Only the captain need to have mod installed for it to work properly.
